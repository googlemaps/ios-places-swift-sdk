# Google Places Swift SDK For iOS Swift package

## Migration Notice

The latest preview version of the GooglePlacesSwift Swift Package has been migrated to the same GitHub repository as GooglePlaces. Please use the new GitHub repository, https://github.com/googlemaps/ios-places-sdk, to access the latest versions of GooglePlaces and GooglePlacesSwift.   

This repository will not be updated for future releases of GooglePlacesSwift.  

**Note:** We are NOT dropping support for GooglePlacesSwift. We are committed to supporting it. This change consolidates the Swift Packages for these two products to make it easier to integrate either or both.

If you have already added GooglePlacesSwift as a Swift Package with the https://github.com/googlemaps/ios-places-swift-sdk URL, please remove it. Use https://github.com/googlemaps/ios-places-sdk as the URL for the Swift Package and, once prompted to add a package product, choose either GooglePlace, GooglePlacesSwift, or both. Please visit https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/ios-sdk/google-places-swift to learn more about GooglePlacesSwift.
